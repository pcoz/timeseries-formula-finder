## From Raw Data to Physical Meaning

### Abstract
Promising Partial Form (PPF) occupies a unique position in the modern information-processing stack. It sits between raw sensory data and high-level AI reasoning, performing the critical task of transforming measurements into explicit, physically meaningful representations. This paper situates PPF within the broader ecosystem of information theory, scientific modeling, and modern AI, including comparisons with neural networks, Bayesian inference, and Feynman-style scientific compression.

## 1. Information, Models, and Reality
Richard Feynman famously described science as the process of discovering the rules by which nature behaves. In information-theoretic terms, this means finding the shortest description that explains the data. PPF implements this principle computationally: it searches for compact mathematical forms that best compress time-series data.

## 2. Where Neural Networks Sit
Neural networks perform statistical interpolation. They learn mappings from inputs to outputs but do not produce explicit representations of the governing processes. They compress data in weight space, but that compression is opaque.

PPF, by contrast, compresses data into equations.

## 3. PPF as a Scientific Compressor
PPF can be viewed as an algorithmic implementation of scientific discovery:
- Decompose phenomena
- Propose candidate laws
- Evaluate explanatory power
- Prefer simpler explanations
- Analyze residuals for missing structure

This mirrors the epistemology of physics.

## 4. Layered Information Architecture
The full information stack becomes:

Raw signal → PPF (laws) → ML (meaning) → Decisions

PPF converts high-entropy data into low-entropy, structured state variables. ML then reasons over those variables.

## 5. Why This Matters
This architecture allows AI systems to be:
- more data-efficient
- more interpretable
- more robust to change
- deployable on constrained devices

It restores the separation between physics and semantics.

## 6. Conclusion
PPF bridges the gap between measurement and understanding. It turns data into laws, allowing AI to reason about the world rather than merely fit it.
